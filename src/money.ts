/**
 * Money, across the one boundary in this connector where it changes shape.
 *
 * The engine speaks minor units and a currency code, always, and never sends a
 * formatted string (AGENTS.md rule 6). Svelte Commerce's types say `price:
 * number`, and every backend it already talks to means "19.99" by that. So the
 * conversion happens here, once, in the only file allowed to divide money.
 *
 * The exponent is per currency, not a constant 100: the yen writes no decimals
 * and the dinar writes three. Dividing 2500 JPY by 100 would price a ¥2,500
 * item at ¥25. The table mirrors `currencyExponent` in core/transfer_shopify.go
 * — the same list, because a second opinion about the yen is a bug.
